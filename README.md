# Project Pitch: Estimating Glacier Velocities using Synthetic Aperture Radar Images

**Team Contract**

**#Goals**
**What are the goals of the team?**
Glacier velocities from SAR data project for image processing class.

**What are your personal goals for the project?**
Eric: Get more experience working with SAR data, try out speckle tracking / feature tracking.
Ahmed: Get exposed with the Glacier velocities behavior at certain condition and figure out the main factors attributed to velocity variation 
Benedicte: Develop visualization skills with real life data (SAR), use different image cleaning techniques and ski-image packages (functions), and develop soft skills through teamwork. 
Bareera: Get hands on experience in working with SAR data and glacier velocities using image analysis techniques as well as speckle tracking/feature tracking.

**What kind of obstacles might you encounter in achieving these goals?**
Pulling in SAR data from outside the US. Github knowledge/coordination. Pacing ourselves/timing.


**Meeting Norms**
When will team meetings be held? What platform will you use for team meetings?
Zoom for meetings. Using whenisgood to find meeting time. Communicate over slack.

**How often will the team meet? How long do you anticipate those meeting will be? **
Once a week tentatively, will adjust as needed. Flexible meeting times.

**Who will take meeting minutes? How will meeting minutes be distributed to team members?**
I can today, rotate other meetings. Keep in google drive.

**Work Norms**
**How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?**
Variable, we will see as we go.
How will work be divided among team members? Will there be specialized roles within the team that take on specific aspects of the project?
Generalized way: data collection, theoretical, someone working on tools, etc.

**Will a specific program be used for managing tasks (e.g. Monday.com, Asana, TeamGantt) or scheduling (e.g. Google Calendar)?**
Whentomeet for scheduling meeting / slack

**What will happen if someone doesn't follow through with a commitment?**
Reach out to them, communication is key!

**How will work be reviewed?**
We are taking inspiration from Zhang et al 2019. Will check to see if realistic values with literature.

**What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of work?**
Use the rubric of the project for standard. Zoom meetings, chats as well.

**What will you do if one or more team members are not doing their share of the work?**
Communicate!

**How will you deal with different work habits of individual team members? (e.g. some people like to get tasks done as early as possible, while others like to work under the pressure of a deadline)**
Communicate and set self-imposed deadlines. Set an agenda for the next meeting. 

**Decision Making**
**How will decisions be made about project direction? Do you need consensus before making a decision?**
Yes, consensus is important. Will build consensus via communication.
