# Estimating the Velocity of Muldrow Glacier during a Surge Event using Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery and Dense Optical Flow

In this project we tried three different approaches to get glacier velocities using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery in order to analyze the recent surge event at Muldrow Glacier. Dense Optical Flow was the most promising, and all results can be seen in our demo notebook titled "muldrow_analysis". Please also check out our final presentation "Final_Project_Poster". The team contract can be found in "team_contract".
